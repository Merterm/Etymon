A new responsive template featuring a flat (but not too flat) minimalistic design, spacious
layout, and styling for all basic page elements. Its demo images* are courtesy of the supremely
talented photographer Felicia Simion. If you like photography or just enjoy being blown away by
awesome stuff, check out her portfolio for more stunning images:

and/or use any of Felicia's work without her explicit permission!)

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)
