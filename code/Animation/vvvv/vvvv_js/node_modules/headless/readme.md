node-headless[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kesla/node-headless.png)](http://travis-ci.org/kesla/node-headless)
=========

node-headless makes it easy to start and use Xvfb in node.
headless is inspired by xvfb-run - it searches for a free X display number and starts Xvfb on that.

API
=======

````javascript
var headless = require('headless');

headless(function(err, childProcess, servernum) {
  // childProcess is a ChildProcess, as returned from child_process.spawn()
  console.log('Xvfb running on server number', servernum);
  console.log('Xvfb pid', childProcess.pid);
  console.log('err should be null', err);
});
````

headless also support an optional number to start searching from.

````javascript
var headless = require('headless');

headless(200, function(err, childProcess, servernum) {
  // servernum will be at least 200
  console.log('Xvfb running on server number', servernum);
  console.log('Xvfb pid', childProcess.pid);
});
````

Options:
- `display`: optional display parameters (`width`, `height` & `depth`). If you want to specify `display`, `width` and `height` are required, but `depth` is optional and defaults to 16.
- `args`: an array of arbitrary additional Xvfb arguments
- `stdio`: set the stdio of the spawned Xvfb process(es). Set this to `'inherit'` to see Xvfb's stdout and stderr for debugging purposes.

````javascript
var headless = require('headless');

var options = {
  display: {width: 1024, height: 980, depth: 32},
  args: ['-extension', 'RANDR'],
  stdio: 'inherit'
};

headless(options, function(err, childProcess, servernum) {
  // childProcess is a ChildProcess, as returned from child_process.spawn()
  console.log('Xvfb running on server number', servernum);
  console.log('Xvfb pid', childProcess.pid);
  console.log('err should be null', err);
});
````

install
=======

With [npm](http://npmjs.org), do:

    npm install headless

If you're having problems with Xvfb-instances not getting killed correctly, and is running on a platform that the posix-module supports, install [child-killer](https://npmjs.org/package/child-killer) (`npm install child-killer`) and headless will automatically use it.
