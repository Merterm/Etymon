== DESCRIPTION ==

The Etymological Wordnet project provides information about how words in different languages 
are etymologically related. The information is mostly mined from the English version of
Wiktionary, but also contains a number of manual additions.


== FORMAT ==

The package includes a Tab-separated values (TSV) file in UTF-8 format with three columns,
providing a word, a relation, and a target word. Words are given with ISO 639-3 codes
(additionally, there are some ISO 639-2 codes prefixed with "p_" to indicate proto-languages).
The most relevant relation is "rel:etymology". To see only etymological relations, run
  grep "rel:etymology" etymwn.tsv | less
on UNIX-based systems.
